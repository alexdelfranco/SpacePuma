    "```SpacePuma``` is an interactive extension to matplotlib designed for use within a jupyter environment. It was originally developed for the processing of astrochemical data but has demonstrated uses across a range of other data-handling fields. The extension combines a series of tools that allow for user input directly through a ```matplotlib```-powered GUI and indirectly through python. Data products, including figures, calculations, and data manipulations, can be exported to a python dictionary or saved through integration with ```pickle```. Customization of ```SpacePuma``` is possible and highly encouraged, with explanations of the necessary modifications covered in the tutorials. All the code is available publicly on GitHub."
